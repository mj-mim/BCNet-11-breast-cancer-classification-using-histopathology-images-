#  BCNet-11: A dilated convolutional neural network for breast cancer classification using histopathology images 
We proposed BCNet-11, a CNN architecture capable of classifying benign and malignant breast cancer based on the Breakhis dataset. We were able to accurately differentiate between benign and malignant classes by making use of the BreakHis dataset, which is a collection of histopathological pictures of breast cancer tissue samples that is available to the public. We utilize the non-local means denoising pre-processing technique in order to clean up the dataset and get rid of the noise. Because there was a substantial gap between the benign and malignant classes, we decided to use the geometric transformation data augmentation technique in order to bring the dataset into better proportion.
